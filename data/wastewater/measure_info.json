The baseline is the 10th percentile of the log-transformed and normalized concentration values, which is calculated within a {variant.norm_frequency}. This is then scaled, where e is the mathmatical constant, and x is the number of standard deviations: $VAL = e^{x}$ These values are categorized as very low, low, moderate, high, or very high using the following breakpoints: {variant.breakpoints}.",

      "description": "Testing for viruses in wastewater can provide an efficient way to identify the levels of virus circulation in the community. The CDCâ€™s National Wastewater Surveillance program obtains samples from select communities around the US and presents the data aggregated by state. These data can provide an early indication of viral activity. Limitations include an inability to link detected back to particular groups of individuals and challenges in comparing viral levels across sites that use different methodologies. The sewage is not necessarily representative of the entire population. These data are made available by the CDC."
